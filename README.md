# Getting started with Spring WebFlux

This simple multi-project repository is to show myself and maybe someone else 
who accidentally found this page how to work with Spring WebFlux.

The first sub-project is **test** and contains only tests.

Thanks to [official documentation on spring.io](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html).
